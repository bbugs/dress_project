###Your Task
1.  Look and study the image carefully.

3.  For each phrase, determine if the phrase does not contain any visual attributes of the dress.  By visual attributes we mean characteristics that can be <b>seen</b> in the image.
4.  Select (check mark) ONLY the phrases that DO NOT contain any visual attributes of the dress.
5.  Check mark the last item "done" to indicate that you are done with this item and you have assessed each phrase.
